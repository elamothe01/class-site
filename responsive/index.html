          The capybara[note 1] or greater capybara (Hydrochoerus
          hydrochaeris) is a giant cavy rodent native to South
          America. It is the largest living rodent[2] and a member
          of the genus Hydrochoerus. The only other extant member
          is the lesser capybara (Hydrochoerus isthmius). Its
          close relatives include guinea pigs and rock cavies,
          and it is more distantly related to the agouti, the
          chinchilla, and the nutria. The capybara inhabits
          avannas and dense forests and lives near bodies of
          water. It is a highly social species and can be found in
          groups as large as 100 individuals, but usually lives in
          groups of 10â€“20 individuals. The capybara is hunted for
          its meat and hide and also for grease from its thick fatty
          xskin.[3] It is not considered a threatened species.
